   ~THE CODED SPEAKER~
   *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*
    
   Assembly:
   Connect a Adafruit 14-Segment display
   to the board. Connect VCC and 5V
   to Power, GND to ground, SDA
   to Analog 4 (A4) and SCL to
   Analog 5. Then, connect a keypad
   to the board. Change the key map
   format to the layout of your keypad.
   Make sure that each pin on your
   keypad is connected to your MetroMini.
   Finally, connect a potentiometer to your
   board. Connect the power input from
   Digital pin 9 on your MetroMini,
   connect ground to ground, and connect
   the output of your potentiometer to
   power of the speaker, then connect
   ground on your speaker to ground.
 
   NOTE: 14 segment displays short
   out VERY easily. make sure you
   disconnect your MetroMini from
   power until you have properly
   set up your 14 segment display.
