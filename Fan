   Items:
   1 polulu Motor Driver
   1 DC 5V Fan
   1 Breadboard
   1 MetroMini

   4 Yellow ground Jumpers
   1 Orange ground jumper
   2 Red Ground Jumpers
   3 Jumpers
   1 Bench Supply
   1 Alagator Jumper (Red)
   1 Alagator Jumper (Black)

   Using the Red ground jumpers, connect Power
   on one side of your board to power on the other
   side, and do the same with Ground.
   Place the MetroMini onto your Breadboard.
   Using 2 Yellow ground jumpers, connect 5V pin on your MetroMini
   to Power on your Breadboard and connect GND pin on your MetroMini
   to Ground on your Breadboard.
   Place the Potentiometer onto your Breadboard. Using 1 Yellow
   ground Jumper and 1 Orange ground jumper, connect a pin on each
   side to power and the other one to ground.
   Using a regular jumper, connect the Middle pin on your Potentiometer
   to Analog Pin 1 on your MetroMini (A1).
   Place the Motor Driver onto your Breadboard. Using a Yellow ground jumper,
   connect GND on the Left Side of your Motor Driver to Ground on your Breadboard.
   Using your Last yellow ground jumper, connect B1 IN to Ground on your Breadboard.
