   *    THE COOLING FAN    *
   *******by pilot674*******
   
   Overview:
   You will never be too hot again! Now
   you can have a working DC fan in the
   palm of your hand! Make sure to follow
   the steps carefully!
   
   Items:
   1 polulu Motor Driver
   1 DC 5V Fan
   1 Breadboard
   1 MetroMini
   1 Potentiometer
   4 Yellow ground Jumpers
   1 Orange ground jumper
   2 Red Ground Jumpers
   3 Jumpers
   1 Bench Supply
   1 Alagator Jumper (Red) 
   1 Alagator Jumper (Black)
   
   **NOTICE**
   If you would prefer a mobile fan, susstatute the "Bench power supply" for
   a battey back. Just hook up power and gound the same as a bench power supply,
   however the battery backs do not require an Alagator jumper. Just plug it in 
   accordingly. Prefferably a battery pack that holds 4 batterys of more.
   Using AA batteries, each battery outputs 1.5V. Multiplying the output
   of your batteries by the amount of batteries you have plugged in will
   give you your Battery back output.
   
   Assembly:
   Using the Red ground jumpers, connect Power
   on one side of your board to power on the other
   side, and do the same with Ground.
   Place the MetroMini onto your Breadboard.
   Using 2 Yellow ground jumpers, connect 5V pin on your MetroMini
   to Power on your Breadboard and connect GND pin on your MetroMini
   to Ground on your Breadboard.
   Place the Potentiometer onto your Breadboard. Using 1 Yellow
   ground Jumper and 1 Orange ground jumper, connect a pin on each
   side to power and the other one to ground.
   Using a regular jumper, connect the Middle pin on your Potentiometer
   to Analog Pin 1 on your MetroMini (A1).
   Place the Motor Driver onto your Breadboard. Using a Yellow ground jumper,
   connect GND on the Right Side of your Motor Driver to Ground on your Breadboard.
   Using your Last yellow ground jumper, connect B1 IN to Ground on your Breadboard.
   Using a regular jumper, connect B2 IN to Digital pin 6 on your MetroMini.
   Place a jumper connected to in GND pin on the Motor Driver on the Left side. On 
   the other end, connect the black alagator jumper. Connect the other end of it to
   ground on your Bench Supply.
   Place a jumper connected to the VIN pin on the Motor Driver. On the other end of 
   the jumper, connect a red alagator jumper. Connect the other end of the red 
   jumper to Power on your Bench supply.
   Connect Ground on your DC fan to B1 OUT on your Motor Driver.
   Connect Power on your DC fan to B2 OUT on your Motor Driver.
   Turn on your Bench Supply and turn Current all the way up and set Voltage to 10.0V
   
   You're ready to use it!
   
   Control the speed of the fan with the Potentiometer.
   
   WARNINGS
   DO NOT try to control the fan
   directly from ANY pin on your MetroMini. That will draw too
   much currect which will cause your MetroMini to short out
   and cause perminent damage
   
   DO NOT turn up your Bench Supply power over 12.0V, this will damage your
   cooling fan and make it overheat
   
   Before plugging in your MetroMini, make sure that all the pins
   are hooked up correctly. If not, this may cause damage to
   your motor driver, fan and/or MetroMini.
   
   DO NOT plug in power and ground from your Bench Supply directly to Power and Ground
   on your Breadboard. This will short out your MotroMini and cause perminent
   damage.
